# LearningAngular
This is a repo to track my progress in learning Angular

I have a plan for learning this below:

# Day 1: Setting Up & Basic Component
Assignment:
Set up Angular using Angular CLI.
Create a basic Angular app with one component displaying a simple message like "Hello, Angular!"
# Day 2: Data Binding & Event Handling
Assignment:
Enhance the previous component by implementing two-way data binding to an input field. Display the entered text dynamically below the input.
# Day 3: Services & Data Management
Assignment:
Create a service that stores an array of strings.
Update the component to fetch data from this service and display the list of strings.
# Day 4: Implementing Routing
Assignment:
Set up routing in your app with at least two routes.
Create components for each route and navigate between them using Angular's router.
# Day 5: Form Creation & Validation
Assignment:
Build a form component that takes user details like name, email, and password.
Implement basic validation on form fields (required, email format).
# Day 6: Reactive Forms
Assignment:
Convert the previously created form to a reactive form.
Add custom validation to ensure password strength.
# Day 7: TypeScript Algorithms
Assignment:
Implement a basic sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort) in TypeScript outside of Angular.
Test the algorithm with a sample array.
# Day 8: Incorporating Algorithms in Angular
Assignment:
Integrate the sorting algorithm into an Angular component.
Create a button that triggers sorting on an array displayed in the component's template.
# Day 9: Algorithmic Filter
Assignment:
Implement a search/filter functionality using a relevant algorithm (e.g., linear search).
Apply it to filter an array of items displayed in a component.
# Day 10: Custom Directives
Assignment:
Create a custom directive that changes the background color of an element when a certain condition is met.
# Day 11: API Integration
Assignment:
Integrate a simple REST API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) into an Angular service.
Display fetched data in a component.
# Day 12-15: Project Development
Assignment:
Begin work on a project like a task manager with CRUD operations.
Start with creating components for adding, listing, updating, and deleting tasks.
# Day 16-20: Project Enhancement
Assignment:
Improve the task manager project by adding validation to the task form, implementing routing for different views, and styling the UI.
# Day 21-30: Project Refinement
Assignment:
Work on enhancing the project with user authentication, data persistence, additional features like search or filtering, and refining the UI/UX.
